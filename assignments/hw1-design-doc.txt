CS122 Assignment 1 - NanoDB Set-Up and Storage Layer - Design Document
======================================================================

A:  Logistics
-------------

A1.  List your team name and the people who worked on this assignment.

     Make Databases Great Again

     Advith Chelikani
     Joonhee Lee
     Charlie Tong

A2.  Specify the repository URL, tag name and commit-hash of the Git version
     you are submitting for your assignment.  (You can list the commit hashes
     of your repository tags with this command:  git show-ref --tags)

     Repository URL:  https://github.com/AChelikani/CS122
     Tag name:        <tag>
     Commit hash:     <hash>

A3.  Specify any late tokens you are applying to this assignment, or
     "none" if no late tokens.

     None

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

     Advith: Set-up, deleting tuples, updating tuples

B:  Deleting and Updating Tuples
--------------------------------

B1.  Briefly describe (1-3 sentences) how you reclaim slot entries in
     the slotted page.  Which slot entries are you able to reclaim?

     Slot entries are reclaimed by checking for consecutive empty slots starting
     from the last slot and working backwards. This chain of consecutive empty
     slots starting from the last slot can be reclaimed. The reclaiming is done
     by resetting the number of slots on the page to the appropriate value.

B2.  Briefly outline the steps of what your setNullColumnValue() function
     does.  You don't have to go into much detail; we can look at your
     code for the details.  Just describe the basic things the function
     must do to set a column-value to NULL.

     We must do the following to set a column-value to NULL: if the column is
     not null we 1) set its flag to null 2) delete all tuple data in the range
     of the column 3) update the page offset by what we just deleted 4) recompute
     the column offsets.

B3.  Similarly, briefly outline the steps of what your
     setNonNullColumnValue() function does.

     Here we first determine if the column is a varchar column, in which case we
     compute the space it takes up. Then if the column is null, we set its null
     flag to false and find the first proceeding column that is not null and set
     aside space there for our tuple. If the column is not null we only need to
     distinguish between varchar because of the variable amount of space. We
     assign space appropriately and then we write the tuple.

C:  Unpinning Tuples and Pages
------------------------------

C1.  Briefly describe your strategy for determining when tuples need to
     be unpinned.  Make sure to comment on plan-nodes and commands.

C2.  In general, you only need to worry about unpinning tuples because
     the backing page will also be unpinned.  However, there are some
     situations when DBPages themselves must be unpinned directly.
     Describe any situations where you unpin pages directly in your
     implementation, and why you do so.  (Make sure to answer this
     question in the context of your insert-optimization changes.)

D:  NanoDB Storage Performance
------------------------------

D1.  In 3-6 sentences, describe your general approach for improving the
     performance of inserts, including what general file-level structuring
     you use of blocks.

D2.  Does your file-level organization have the potential to increase the
     number of large disk seeks when performing inserts?  What steps do
     you take, if any, to reduce the number of disk seeks?

D3.  What steps must be taken during a tuple-delete operation to update
     your file-level structures?  How many pages must be written to?

D4.  What steps must be taken after a tuple-insert operation that fills
     the data page?

D5.  Describe your criteria for when a page is considered to be "full."

E:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.

E1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

E2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

E3.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

E4.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

E5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
