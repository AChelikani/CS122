    Advith: simple selects, subqueries in from clause, order by clause, join support in query planner
    Joon: Grouping and aggregation (including GroupAggregationProcessor), pin/unpinning details
    Charlie: Inner joins, left/right outer joins, semijoins, antijoins, natural joins + corresponding tests

B:  Simple Planner
------------------

B1.  Without going into the details of how you handle grouping and
     aggregation or joins, list the general sequence of steps that your
     planner's makePlan() method follows to translate a SQL query into
     an execution plan.

     Checks if a from clause exists - if not then does a simple select. If it does,
     then determine if there is no predicate, if there is a select in the from clause,
     or there is a join and deal with the case appropriately. Then process the where
     clause, checking to make sure there are no aggregation functions in it. Then
     process grouping and aggregation expressions. Then check if it is a trivial project.
     Finally, check for any order by expressions.

B2.  Does your planner try to simplify plans in specific circumstances,
     e.g. when a "trivial project" is used (i.e. "SELECT * FROM ...") in
     your planner?  Briefly enumerate all simplifications and optimizations
     your planner employs.

B3.  Describe how you generate the execution-plan fragment for the query's
     FromClause.  Make sure to touch on what you do in the three cases your
     planner is expected to handle - tables, subqueries in the FROM clause,
     and joins.

     In the tables case (BASE_TABLE), we invoke the makeSimpleSelect on the base
     table name. In the subqueries in FROM clause case (SELECT_SUBQUERY) we
     invoke make plan on the inner select clause. In the joins case (JOIN_EXPR)
     we invoke NestedLoopJoinNode on the left and right children in the from clause,
     making sure to dedup columns when necessary.

B4.  Describe how you implemented support for grouping and aggregation.
     Be sure to note any variations from the approach outlined in class,
     if there are any.

     First, we created the GroupAggregationProcessor class. This class
     was used to scan the SELECT and HAVING clauses for any aggregate
     functions, which were replaced with auto-generated column names
     after being stored in a HashMap mapping the names to the functions.
     This also modified the selectValues to select for the new column
     names.

     Also, we scanned the GROUP BY clause using the processor to locate
     any complex expressions (i.e. not simple columns). These were
     also stored in a HashMap from auto-generated names to the expressions,
     and then a ProjectNode was used to compute and create these new
     columns before the GroupAggregationNode was applied. Naturally,
     when we scanned the SELECT clause for aggregate functions, we also
     scanned for the complex expressions found in the GROUP BY clause.
     Finally, we created a function to rename all the selected columns
     from auto-generated names such as "#A0" to logical names such as
     "SUM(T.C)".

B5.  Describe how you implemented support for natural joins, and joins with
     a USING clause.  Focus on how you handle challenging cases, such as
     t1(a, b) NATURAL JOIN t2(a, c) NATURAL JOIN t3(a, d).

C:  Nested-Loop Join
--------------------

C1.  The join algorithm stated in class is really only suitable for
     materialized evaluation, where the entire result is generated by the
     algorithm.  It is completely unsuitable for pipelined evaluation,
     where results are generated row by row.

     Summarize how your implementation works for inner joins, using
     pseudocode to show how rows are considered and returned as the
     algorithm executes, and what state must be saved so that the
     operation can resume at the appropriate place when the next row
     must be returned.

     INNER joins are evaluated by keeping track of the previous leftTuple
     and rightTuple returned. The rightTuple is advanced by pulling from
     the rightChild until an acceptable tuple pair is found. When the rightChild
     reaches the end, it is reset and the leftChild is advanced by 1. When the
     leftChild reaches the end of the stream, the entire loop terminates.

C2.  What tweaks did you need to introduce into the implementation for
     left outer joins?  Keep your answer brief, but please also be specific.

     In LEFT OUTER joins, the left tuple is tracked to make sure that if it is
     not matched with a right tuple, it is still returned padded with null.

     To do this, we maintain a consistent state of the loop: the current
     leftTuple value upon entering getNextTuple() is the one returned by
     the previous call. Thus, if and only if we advance the left tuple once and
     then reach the end of the rightChild stream without finding an appropriate
     match, then we return leftTuple padded with null.

C3.  Same question as for C2, but for semijoins.

     Upon matching, we advance the right stream to the end (thus forcing the
     next iteration to advance the leftTuple) before returning the match. Thus,
     each leftTuple is returned at most once; it is compared with the full right
     stream; and it is returned only upon matching.

C4.  Same question as for C2, but for antijoins.

     Upon matching, we advance the right stream to the end and keep pulling
     pairs of tuples. This effectively "skips" over a leftTuple that matches.
     If we reach the end of the right stream, this means the entire right stream
     did not match, and so we return leftTuple.

C5.  Enumerate your nested-loop join test cases, following this form:

     * TestSimpleJoins.testInnerJoin
       Test INNER joins with ON condition for empty and nonempty tables.

     * TestSimpleJoins.testLeftOuterJoin
       Test LEFT OUTER joins with ON condition for empty and nonempty tables.

     * TestSimpleJoins.testRightOuterJoin
       Test RIGHT OUTER joins with ON condition for empty and nonempty tables.

     * TestNaturalJoins.testNaturalJoin
       Test NATURAL joins on two matching columns: [t1(a, b, c), t2(a, b, d)]

     * TestUsingJoins.testUsingJoinSingleColumn
       Test joins with USING on single matching column: [t1(a, b), t2(a, c)]

     * TestUsingJoins.testUsingJoinDoubleColumn
       Test joins with USING on two matching columns: [t1(a, b, c), t2(a, b, d)]

D:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

D1:  Implemented unit tests for NATURAL and USING joins

     Tested NATURAL and USING join functionality in two files:
       TestNaturalJoins.java
       TestUsingJoins.java

     The test cases cover multiple column joins and deduplication.

E:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.
